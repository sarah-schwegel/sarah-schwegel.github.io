                    I am a student and disability rights advocate passionate about making positive change for members of the disability 
                    community.

                <p>
                    In my professional life I strive to empower disabled youth to follow their passion and and set goals for 
                    their future. As an individual I advocate for Medicaid reform that will reduce employment barriers for 
                    people with disabilities.
